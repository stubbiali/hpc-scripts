# MeluXina

This folder contains Bash scripts for the MeluXina supercomputer.

The following files are application-agnostic:
* `salloc.sh`, to ask for an interactive allocation on the compute nodes;
* `submit.sh`, to submit a Slurm batch job;
* `clean_scratch.sh`, to delete all temporary files generated by Slurm.

We suggest creating a symlink to the files above in your `$SCRATCH`.

**Remark:** It is intended that *all* files mentioned in this README should be issued
from within `$SCRATCH`.

The following applications are fully supported:
* FVM

Below you can find detailed instructions to get started with each supported application.


## FVM

It is assumed that you have cloned the branch `$BRANCH` of the FVM repository under
`$SCRATH/fvm-gt4py/$BRANCH`. The following files are available:

* `install_fvm.sh`, to install FVM and all its dependencies;
* `prepare_fvm.sh`, to load all the modules required to run the model and set the path to the
source code;
* `run_fvm_cpu.sh`, to run the model on CPU;
* `run_fvm_gpu.sh`, to run the model on GPU;
* `submit_fvm.sh`, to run the model from within Slurm jobs.
