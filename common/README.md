# Dot files

This folder contains configuration ("dot") files for some tools which are commonly
used by programmers on a remote system (e.g. the Bash shell, Vim). If you want to use one of the
provided dot file, we suggest creating a symlink to the file in your `$HOME`. 

**Remark:** Should a file with the same name of the chosen dot file already exist in `$HOME`, 
we highly recommend creating a backup copy of that file before proceeding, so to avoid any
irreversible damage.

The file `prepare_scratch.sh` represents an exception: it should be run in your `$SCRATCH`
before executing any other scripts contained in the repository.
